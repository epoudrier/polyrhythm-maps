# Premieres Map

This map is meant to show the locations of where certain works first premiered. The original interactive map included features that were displayed as a heat map at certain levels. When zoomed in, a user could click on a work and get metadata elements.

# Proposed Solution

1. Create map document using Leaflet JS/CSS, using a CARTO basemap ([https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles)). Alternatively Stamen Designs or other OpenStreetMap-based basemap that allows use without API.
2. Transform a copy of existing csv data into GeoJSON to be queried and displayed as map layer. This GeoJSON file will be stored in this `premieres` directory.
3. Test and implement Leaflet marker clusters plugin ([https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)).
4. Add to the resulting `premieres-map.html` file inline comments inside the `<html>` and `<script>` tags to indicate where and how to make future configurations. This README.md will also include written instructions describing the files/content of this directory.
