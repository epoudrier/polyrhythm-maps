# Timeline Map

This map is meant to show the locations of where certain works premiered over time. The original interactive maps included features that allowed the user to filter the data by:

- Works title
- Composer
- Genre
- Time range

The timeline feature allowed users to "play" the map to show locations highlight in the map automatically as the slider moved through time.

# Proposed Solution

1. Create map document using Leaflet JS/CSS, using a CARTO basemap ([https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles)). Alternatively Stamen Designs or other OpenStreetMap-based basemap that allows use without API.
2. Transform a copy of existing csv data into GeoJSON to be queried and displayed as map layer. This GeoJSON file will be stored in this `premieres` directory.
3. Test and implement Leaflet time slider plugin (example: [http://dwilhelm89.github.io/LeafletSlider/](http://dwilhelm89.github.io/LeafletSlider/)).
4. Add to the resulting `timeline-map.html` file inline comments inside the `<html>` and `<script>` tags to indicate where and how to make future configurations. This README.md will also include written instructions describing the files/content of this directory.
